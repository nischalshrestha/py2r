# py2r

This is an example of an interactive transfer lesson for Python programmers switching to R using the lovely `learnr` [package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html). It makes use of the `reticulate` [package](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to switch between Python and R code snippets. The `learnr` package is being used for the interactivity which now is scope to code execution exercises in R with basic checks in the backend.

You can run this locally in RStudio or view the tutorial here: https://nshrest.shinyapps.io/py2r_transfer/

# Motivation

Data scientists have realized that the language war between Python and R for data science are fruitless. Instead, [a love story](https://rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/) has developed, where both languages can be used for various purposes, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses. But how do we train programmers who are new to one or the other?

# Interactive transfer lessons

This is my attempt to explore a new way to create interactive learning experiences for programmers who may switch from one language to another. The case study here is Python to R, and it only covers some basics on dataframe manipulations. I hope this at the very least can start a conversation among educators and professional programmers about how we teach languages, enabling previous knowledge yet reducing interference.
