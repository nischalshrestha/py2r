df <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,NA), b=c(NA, 4, 5), c=c(6,7,8))

## `slice`

### The problem with slicing using `[`

Let's see what happens when we subset rows of `df` with a range that clearly exceeds the total number of rows. 

```{r}
df
```

In Python, there are no surprises.

```{python echo=TRUE}
df[1:10]
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

However, execute the same operation in R:

```{r subset_bad, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
df[1:10, ]
```

**Python â‡’ R GOTCHA!** In R, if you slice for more rows than there are in a dataframe, extra rows full of missing values or `NA`s will be added!

This results from a concept called [vector recycling](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#scalars-and-recycling-rules). In a nutshell, R prefers performing operations on equal sized vectors and will "recycle" the shorter one to meet the length of the bigger one---fair enough! The shorter vector in our case is the number of rows `df` has which we know to be 3:

```{r echo=TRUE}
nrow(df)
```

But the range we specified to subset is `1:10`, a vector that is 10 elements long. So R recycles the 3 until reaching the 10, but it will create rows with `NA` which makes sense because it has no idea what you want the values to be! But, this is certainly confusing coming from Python.

Tinker with your code above and change the range so that it exceeds 3 and you'll see it pads as many rows as required.

Here's where our first tidy verb `slice` comes in handy, which behaves as you'd expect in Python. Try out `slice(df, start:end)` where `df` is your dataframe, `start:end` is a range for the rows you want from `df`. It should make you happy with the results:
```{r slice, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r slice-hint, include=FALSE}
slice(df, start:end)
```

Sadly, our story does not end here with `[`. Let's explore other problems in the next topic.
