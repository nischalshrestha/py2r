## `summarize`

Now that we have covered some of the most fundamental verbs in Tidy R, we will bring it all together in this last topic by covering `summarize` to collapse a dataframe into meaninful stats. `summarize` is synonymous with `summarise`, calling either one will work but we'll stick with the "z".

### Summarize ungrouped dataframe

Let's start by summarizing the `mtcars` dataframe which will simply report on the mean of **disp**  and how many instances of **disp** there are per group. For now we don't have any groups, so it will be the entire `mtcars`.

In Python, we can do aggregate type calculations with `agg` which accepts a dict where the key is the column name and the value is the operation:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.agg({'disp': ['mean', 'count']}).shape
```
No surprises here. The **disp** column's mean and the number of observations (rows) per group, which is 1 (the entire dataframe) is 32 because there are 32 observations.

In R, we can use the verb `summarize`:

```{r summarize, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=4}
mtcars %>% summarize(mean = mean(disp), n = n())
```
There you have it! The only difference here is that the dataframe is a single row unlike two rows in Python.

### Summarize grouped dataframe

Often times though, you will want to first group the dataframe with a variable(s) before performing the aggregated operation(s). So, let's first group by **cyl** like we did in the previous topic. Then, let's do the same stats as above.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

We can use Python's `groupby` first then use `agg`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
by_cyl = mtcars.groupby('cyl')
by_cyl.agg({'disp': ['mean', 'count']})
print(f"\nGroups: {len(by_cyl.groups)}")
```

Pay attention to the output of that print statement, we'll circle back to that after you see the R side.

In R, we first use `group_by` and then we use `summarize` as before:

<!-- # Usually, you'll want to group first -->
```{r group_by-summarize, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=4}
by_cyl <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)
by_cyl %>% summarize(mean = mean(disp), n = n())

```

Whala! Again, the results are the same as expected except for the dimensions of the returning dataframe. 

However, let's see what happens when we store the resulting dataframe and call a `group_vars` on it. `group_vars` essentially prints out the grouping variables of the dataframe. Execute the code below to see what happens:

```{r group_by-summarize-ungrouped, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6}
by_cyl <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)
by_cyl <- by_cyl %>% summarize(mean = mean(disp), n = n())
by_cyl
by_cyl %>% group_vars()
```
We have our result of the `summarize` but also notice how we get an empty vector of type `character`. 

**Python â‡’ R GOTCHA!** Unlike Python's `agg`, R's `summarize` automatically ungroups one level of the grouped dataframe! This is because that group is now just a single row.

This means in the above example we had one grouped variable: **cyl**. This effectively gets stripped when using `summarize` so that we no longer consider the dataframe to be grouped.

So are we doomed to also ungroup after `summarize`? When using `summarize`, pretty much. But there's a solution. If you want to keep the original grouped variables use `mutate` instead:

```{r group_by-summarize-group_vars, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6}
by_cyl <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)
by_cyl <- by_cyl %>% mutate(mean = mean(disp), n = n())
by_cyl
by_cyl %>% group_vars()
```
Note how the **cyl** gets printed from `group_vars`, which means anything else we do will still consider the dataframe to be grouped.

### Multiple columns/variables

One thing we haven't yet done is group by multiple variables. We will now group by both **cyl** and **vs** (Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)) and calculate the mean of the **disp** and **mpg** variables.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

As before, we use Python's `groupby` first this time supplying a list of the variables. Then use `agg` to calculate count:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
by_cyl_vs = mtcars.groupby(['cyl', 'vs'])
by_cyl_vs.agg({'disp': 'mean', 'mpg': 'mean'})
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

We do the same as last time but add the **vs** column to group by, then `summarize`:

```{r group_by-summarize-multiple-variables, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl, vs) %>%
  summarize(mean_disp = mean(disp), mean_mpg = mean(mpg))

```

The above operation still ungroups, but just one level. Here is the same code this time saving the resulting dataframe to reveal what grouped variables are left with `group_vars`:

```{r group_by-summarize-multiple-variables-stripped, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6}
# storing way
by_cyl <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl, vs)
by_cyl <- by_cyl %>% summarize(mean_disp = mean(disp), mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
by_cyl
by_cyl %>% group_vars()
```
Notice how we only print **cyl** even though originally we also had **vs**, which got stripped away after the `summarize`!

If we wanted to add one more function call a `select` we will no longer consider **vs** as a grouping variable. The first `select` here selects the **vs** which is still present:

```{r group_by-summarize-multiple-variables-stripped-attempt-1, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, warning=FALSE}
# storing way
by_cyl <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl, vs)
by_cyl %>% 
  summarize(mean_disp = mean(disp), mean_mpg = mean(mpg)) %>%
  select(vs)


```
We can use `ungroup` if we don't want to manually remove the next group level which is **cyl** in this case. Execute the code below to see what happens when we select **vs** after the `ungroup`:

```{r group_by-summarize-multiple-variables-stripped-attempt-2, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8}
by_cyl <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl, vs)
by_cyl %>% 
  summarize(mean_disp = mean(disp), mean_mpg = mean(mpg)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(vs)
  
```
This time we only get the **vs** column back without the **cyl**.

Let's do one final exercise to wrap up the `summarize` topic:

- Group mtcars by **cyl** and **gear**
- Summarize the following:
  - mean of **disp** to a "mean_disp" column
  - max of **hp** to a "max_hp" column (use `max` function)

```{r group_by-summarize-exercise, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6}

```

```{r group_by-summarize-exercise-hint-1}
mtcars %>%
    group_by(...) %>%
    summarize(...)
```

```{r group_by-summarize-exercise-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(
    .,
    mtcars %>%
      group_by(cyl, gear) %>%
      summarize(mean_disp = mean(disp), max_hp = max(hp))
    )
  )
)
```

#### If you want to learn more:

There are more advanced things you can do with `group_by` and `summarize` which you can check out in the [docs](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html). The entire [reference](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) is also a great resource for the rest of your journeys manipulating and wrangling dataframes. 

### Where to go next?

Your journey has just begun. There is a lot that we didn't cover about other aspects of analysis like plotting and all the ways to read data. A couple of resources:

- The R4DS [book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) 
- There is also the [R4DS](https://www.rfordatasci.com) community, highly recommend their slack!
- Also feel free to reach out to the #rstats community on Twitter with a question, they are quite active and willing to help out!
