## Enter Tidy R

Up to this point we have been using functions and operations in "base" R which is what's included in R from the get-go. These include operators `[` and functions like `head`. Although these operators and functions are fine, they can be clunky to use and don't handle missing values and out-of-bound vectors properly selecting subsets of the dataframe.

The tidyverse is a collection of packages that is designed to handle operations in a safe and consistent manner, while providing intuitive functions:

- `slice`: choose observations (rows) by row numbers
- `filter`: choose observations (rows) by value(s)
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `select`: choose variables (columns) by name
- `mutate`: derive new variables from existing ones
- `group_by`: define subsets of rows for further processing
- `summarize`: combine many values to create a single new value

## The problem with `[`

If we used the `[` in R, it can behave in inconsistent ways. For example let's work with the dataframe below called `df` which has some missing values:

```{r}
df
```
