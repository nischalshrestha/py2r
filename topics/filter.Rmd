## `filter`

### The problem with filtering in base R

Now let's look at filtering with the same `df`:

```{r}
df
```

### The problem with filtering using `[`

In Python, we can safely use `[` to filter `df` for rows where **a** is greater than 1

```{python bracket_handled-1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
df[df.a > 1]
```

and also where **b** is greater than 1:

```{python bracket_handled-2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
df[df.b > 1]
```

Now in R, try using `[` to filter `df` for rows where **a** is greater than 1 notice what happens:

```{r bracket_bad, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

Now, try using `[` to filter `df` for rows where **b** is greater than 1:

```{r bracket_bad-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

If you don't see it yet, the issue for both of these operations is that they both kept rows with `NA` even though we wouldn't normally see them in Python.

### Enter `filter`

Our next verb `filter` addresses the issues with filtering using `[`. 

The syntax is: `filter(df, condition)`

```{r filter_good-example-1, echo=TRUE}
filter(df, a > 1)
```
```{r filter_good-example-2, echo=TRUE}
filter(df, b > 1)
```

Note how the column in the condition does not need to be referenced from the data using `$`

Notice also how we don't run into any issues now even with `NA` in our dataframe, thereby mimicing Python's behavior. 

Try tinkering with `filter` yourself:

```{r filter_good, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```
