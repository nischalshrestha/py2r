## `filter`

### The problem with filtering in base R

Now let's look at filtering with the a simple dataframe called `df`:

```{r}
df
```

### The problem with filtering using `[`

In Python, we can safely use `[` to filter `df` for rows where **a** is greater than 1

```{python bracket_handled-1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
df[df.a > 1]
```

and also where **b** is greater than 1:

```{python bracket_handled-2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
df[df.b > 1]
```

Now in R, try using `[` to filter `df` for rows where **a** is greater than 1 notice what happens:

```{r bracket_bad, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

Now, try using `[` to filter `df` for rows where **b** is greater than 1:

```{r bracket_bad-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

**GOTCHA!** If you don't see it yet, the issue for both of these operations is that they both kept rows with `NA` even though we wouldn't normally see them in Python.

### Enter `filter`

Our next verb `filter` addresses the issues with filtering using `[`. 

The syntax is: `filter(df, condition)`

```{r filter_good-example-1, echo=TRUE}
filter(df, a > 1)
```
```{r filter_good-example-2, echo=TRUE}
filter(df, b > 1)
```

Note how the column in the condition does not need to be referenced from the data using `$`

Notice also how we don't run into any issues now even with `NA` in our dataframe, thereby mimicing Python's behavior.

Try playing `filter` yourself:

```{r filter_play, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

Depending on what you tried, you may have run into some confusion about all of its capabilities like multiple conditions etc. which we will now cover.

### Multiple conditions

What if we want to apply multiple conditions? Let's say we're looking to buy one of those cars in mtacrs dataset and we want cars such that their **mpg** is greater than 20 and there are 6 *cyl* or cylinders.

<!-- TODO: , means & but & can also be used -->

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

Think back to using `query` in Python:

```{python query, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.query('mpg > 20 & cyl == 6')
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

We can mimic Python's `query` using R's `filter` to do the same operation, which also looks syntactically similar:

```{r filter-multiple, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20 & cyl == 6)
```

The difference is that the conditions don't need to be quoted. `filter` also allows using `,` to indicate the `&` boolean operator. Note that this is the only shorthand and just applies to `&` not for other operators like `|`. Execute the following:

```{r filter-multiple-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20, cyl == 6)
```

**GOTCHA!** You might have noticed something different for both outputs compared to Python. Where are the rownames?!

The one small downside of `filter` and some other verbs is that rownames can be silently dropped. Often times, this doesn't matter for analysis. 

However, we have a way to preserve the names using the `rownames_to_column` function from the `tibble` package within the `tidyverse` package. If you imported `tidyverse` there is no need to import it. 

Fix the code below by calling `rownames_to_column` to our data in the first argument:

```{r filter-exercise, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20, cyl == 6)
```

```{r filter-exercise-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, filter(rownames_to_column(mtcars), mpg > 20, cyl == 6)), "We got our rownames back!"),
  fail_if(~ identical(.result, filter(mtcars, mpg > 20, cyl == 6)), "Oops! Still missing the rownames.")
)
```

There you have it! We have covered the basics of `filter`, an important verb in our data analysis toolkit!

There is a ton you can do with `filter` and we will come back to it in our last topic, but you can always dig into the [docs](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) to learn more!
