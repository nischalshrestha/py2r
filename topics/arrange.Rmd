## `arrange`

### Sorting rows by a column

Our next verb `arrange` will help us sort rows. Let's sort the mtcars dataset by mpg first by ascending order then descending order. Here is `mtcars` again:

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

You were probably using `sort_values` in Python to sort rows:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.sort_values(by='mpg')
```

and we needed to pass in a `False` to the `ascending` parameter to indicate descending order:

```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.sort_values(by='mpg', ascending=False)
```

In R, there are a couple of ways to sort. First let's look at the base R way.

You can use the `order` function:

```{r base-sort-simple, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg),]
```

and unlike Python, for descending order, you merely prepend the column reference with `-`:

```{r base-sort-simple-desc, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
mtcars[order(-mtcars$mpg),]
```

However, it's a little clunky to have to reference the column using `$` everytime. What if we left out the `mtcars$` part?

Try executing the code below:

```{r base-sort-bad, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
mtcars[order(mpg), ]
```

**GOTCHA!** R is confused what the `mpg` is when directly referencing it without the use of `$`! You should've seen an error:
```
Error: Must use a vector in `[`, not an object of class matrix.
```

There is a way to avoid this by first using `attach` which you can think of as adding a path for R to search for. `attach` allows you to add `mtcars` into the search path, which means it helps R figure out that you meant the `mpg` column without direct reference:

```{r base-sort-better, message=FALSE, warning=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
attach(mtcars)
mtcars[order(mpg), ]
```

and descending:

```{r base-sort-better-descending, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
attach(mtcars)
mtcars[order(-mpg), ]
```

Note how we didn't have to reference the `mpg` using the `$` anymore. But that's one extra function just to achieve direct reference, just so we can sort easily. There must be a better way, something like Python's `sort_values`!

### Enter `arrange`:

Using `arrange` we can directly mention the columns we want to sort the rows by:

```{r tidy-sort, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
arrange(mtcars, mpg)
```

then for descending we prepend a `-` like we did for `order`:

```{r tidy-sort-minus, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
arrange(mtcars, -mpg)
```
If the `-` is confusing, there is a convenient function called `desc()` which can be used to sort by descending order:

```{r tidy-sort-desc, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
arrange(mtcars, desc(mpg))
```

The `-` and `desc` do the same thing but the latter is clearer in intention.

**Base R â‡’ Tidy R GOTCHA!** If you haven't noticed yet, unlike the `order` function used in base R, the rownames are silently dropped when using `arrange`. As mentioned before, if row names are important to you, use the `rownames_to_column()` function.

Let's do that now. Go ahead and use `rownames_to_column()` on `mtcars`, then make use of that `%>%` to pipe the result to `arrange`, sorting by **mpg** descending order. Finally, pipe the result to a `head` as we only want to gander at the first few rows:

```{r tidy-sort-chain, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r tidy-sort-chain-hint}
rownames_to_column(...) %>% 
  verb(...) %>% 
  verb(...)
```

```{r tidy-sort-chain-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(., rownames_to_column(mtcars) %>% arrange(-mpg) %>% head()), "")
)
```

### Sorting rows by multiple columns

Now, let's sort by **cyl** and **disp**, first in ascending then in descending order:

Once again you have done this using `sort_values` in Python using a list of columns:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.sort_values(by=['cyl', 'disp'])
```

and in descending order:

```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.sort_values(by=['cyl', 'disp'], ascending=False)
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

We can use `arrange` to do the same in R:

```{r tidy-sort-multiple, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
arrange(mtcars, cyl, disp)
```

and in descending order:

```{r tidy-sort-multiple-minus, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
arrange(mtcars, -cyl, -disp)
```

or

```{r tidy-sort-multiple-desc, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
arrange(mtcars, desc(cyl), desc(disp))
```

We have now covered the basics of `arrange`. Give yourself a pat in the back! You can now slice, select, filter and arrange dataframes! On to the next!
