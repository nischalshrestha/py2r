## Indexing rows and columns

Before you learn anything else about dataframe manipulations, you need to make it safely across the landmines waiting in the "indexing syntax" field before you. In this topic, we'll get you safely across and teach you the gotchas in R when moving from Python's row/column indexing.

### Index column

Let's try to index the column **mpg** column from mtcars.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

You are used to indexing a column using either `[` or dot notation:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars['mpg'].head()
```
```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars['mpg']
```

```{python py-column-indexing}
print(mtcars['mpg'])
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

You can use the `[` as well. Try it out now by referencing the **mpg** column:

```{r column, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r column-hint}
mtcars[col_name]
```

```{r column-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, mtcars['mpg']), "Easy enough!"),
  fail_if(~ identical(.result, mtcars$mpg), "Using $ is fine but doesn't return a dataframe as explained in the next exercise.")
)
```

**Python ⇒ R GOTCHA!** Using the `.` notation to reference a column does not work in R. Try executing `mtcars.mpg`

```{r wrong-reference, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 2, echo=TRUE}

```

Since `.` can be included in a variable name, R thinks you are trying to reference a variable. The `.` cannot be used to reference a column as you would expect coming from Python.

Instead use `$`:
```{r column-indexing-2,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r column-indexing-2-check, include = FALSE}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, mtcars$mpg), "Use $ when you need to reference a column.")
)
```

### Partial column name matching

What if we don't completely write out the column name when referencing? Let's try doing something strange, like reference a column **cy** which doesn't exist in `mtcars`.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

In Python:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars.cy
```
```
AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'cy'
```

As expected, we get a `AttributeError` because the column does not exist. This syntax also throws an error, this time a `KeyError`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars['cy']
```
```
KeyError: 'cy'
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

Let's try the same thing in R. First with `$`:

```{r dollar-gotcha, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
mtcars$cy

```

Wait what?! No errors!

**Python ⇒ R GOTCHA!** Instead of throwing an error like in Python, when given a partial column name, R will attempt to find the column with the substring and return that column.

In the above code, the `$cy` returned the **cyl** column because of the partial match. Try executing this code as well if you're still unconvinced:

```{r dollar-gotcha-1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
mtcars$ca

```
This time, the `$ca` matches up with the **carb** column. 

However, if given just a 'c', then R has no clue which column you want:
```{r dollar-gotcha-2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
mtcars$c

```
But this still doesn't result in an error. Instead R returns `NULL` to signify the column doesn't exist.

This behavior won't matter as much when we transition to a new style of R programming ("Enter Tidy" and later topics). However, it's worth pointing out here so you will be familiar with it when we revisit this issue later.

### Index a single element

Suppose we want to reference the fifth element of the **mpg** column.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

In Python, you can use `[` on the dataframe to reference the **mpg** column then `[` again to access the fifth item:

```{python echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mtcars['mpg'][4]
``` 

```{python py-single}
print(mtcars['mpg'][4])
```

**Note** how Python is 0-indexed.

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

We instead use `$` to reference **mpg**, then use `[` like Python for accessing the element. Try it out!

```{r single, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r single-hint}
"Remember that we start counting from 1 in R."
```

```{r single-check, include = FALSE}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, mtcars$mpg[5]), "Pretty easy right?")
)
```

You may wonder why we didn't use the `[` syntax instead.

**Python ⇒ R GOTCHA!** Using `[` returns a dataframe, so accessing the fifth element will throw an error because you have only one column **mpg** returned. See for yourself!

```{r single-check-wrong, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3, exercise.eval = TRUE}

```

### Indexing multiple columns

What if we wanted to select **mpg**, **cyl** and **hp** columns?

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

In Python, one could either use `[[` or the `.loc`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars[['mpg', 'cyl', 'hp']]
```
```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars.loc[:, ['mpg', 'cyl', 'hp']]
```

```{python}
mtcars[['mpg', 'cyl', 'hp']]
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

However in R, the `[[` does not work for multiple columns. Go ahead and try it out:

```{r columns-index-bad, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

You should've seen a `subscript out of bounds` error. This is because dataframes in R are lists of columns and `[[` is used to reference a column label. So the inner `[` used as a list in Python does not work.

Instead, replace the inner `[` with `c()` which creates a list out of elements:

```{r columns-indexing,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r columns-indexing-check, include = FALSE}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, mtcars[c('mpg', 'cyl', 'hp')]))
)
```

### Dropped Dimensions when selecting one column

Let's examine what happens when we only want to subset a single column, say **mpg**.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

No surprises here for Python:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars[['mpg']]
```

The returned object is a `DataFrame`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
type(mtcars[['mpg']])
```

which means we can still subset it further using **mpg**:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars[['mpg']].mpg.head()
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

This is the equivalent in R: 

```{r rows-column-dropped, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
mtcars[['mpg']]
```

Now execute this code to look at the returned type:

```{r rows-column-dropped-dim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
typeof(mtcars[['mpg']])
```
This one is more surprising! The object that gets returned is actually a `double` vector.

**Python ⇒ R GOTCHA!** Unlike Python, subsetting a single column using `[[` returns a vector not a dataframe. R will drop the dataframe dimension and return a vector instead.

To fix this, we could use the alternate syntax where we just access the column using either `$` or `[`:
```{r rows-column-dropped-fix-attempt-alt-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
mtcars['mpg']
typeof(mtcars['mpg'])
```

or with a list using `c()`:

```{r rows-column-dropped-fix-attempt-alt-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
mtcars[c('mpg')]
typeof(mtcars[c('mpg')])
```

This also gives back a dataframe which is a `list` in R.

### Indexing rows

<!-- TODO: -->
<!-- - Gotcha: drop=FALSE is required to not drop dimensionality -->

What about indexing rows? Let's select the first two rows of mtcars.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

In Python, one could just use the `[` or the `.iloc`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars[0:2]
```
```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars.iloc[0:2]
```

```{python}
print(mtcars[0:2])
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

In R, we count from 1 but you need to be more careful when using `[` to index rows. Execute the following:

```{r row-index-bad, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3, eval=TRUE}
mtcars[1:2]
```

Oops! R will select columns by default using `[` so the first two columns were selected instead of the rows. To fix this, we can use the `data[row_index, col_index]` form instead, where the left side of the comma is the row index and the right side the column index. 

To fix our example, we just add a comma after `1:2` and leave the `col_index` side empty to select all columns:

```{r rows-indexing, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}

```

```{r rows-indexing-hint-1}
"Remember to add the comma for indexing rows!"
```

```{r rows-indexing-hint-2}
mtcars[row_index, ]
```

```{r rows-indexing-check, include = FALSE}
# print(~ identical(.result, mtcars$mpg[5]))
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, mtcars[1:2, ]))
)
```

### Indexing rows and columns

Indexing both the rows and columns is much more simple for both Python and R if we follow the `data[row_index, col_index]` form for both.

Let's select the first 3 rows of the **mpg** and **cyl** columns of mtcars.

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

For Python, one can either use either the `[[` or `.iloc`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars[['mpg','cyl']][0:3]
mtcars.iloc[0:3, 0:2]
```

Or using the `.loc` which is rather tedious as one has to mention the row names:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars.loc['Mazda RX4':'Datsun 710', ['mpg','cyl']]
```


```{python}
print(mtcars[['mpg','cyl']][0:3])
```

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

In R, we can use the `[` syntax then refer to columns as either number indices or column labels using the `data[row_indices, col_indices]` form. 

Give it a try:

```{r rows-columns-indexing, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}

```

```{r rows-columns-indexing-hint-1}
"You can use c() to specify column labels (e.g. 'col1', 'col2' etc.) or indices (e.g. 0, 1 etc.)"
```

```{r rows-columns-indexing-hint-2}
mtcars[row_index, c(columns)]
```

```{r rows-columns-indexing-check, include = FALSE}
# print(~ identical(.result, mtcars$mpg[5]))
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, mtcars[1:3, c('mpg', 'cyl')]), "You're getting the hang of this! :)")
)
```

### Dropped dimension when indexing rows and columns

What if we subsetted the column `mpg` and the first two rows using the `data[row_indices, col_indices]` form and wanted a dataframe as a result?

<img src="../images/python_logo.png" class="language-icon">

In Python, we can use the `.iloc` which requires putting the index of **mpg** (0) in a list on the column side:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.iloc[0:2, [0]]
```

The returned object is a `DataFrame`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
type(mtcars.iloc[0:2, [0]])
```

which means we can still subset it further using **mpg**:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
type(mtcars.iloc[0:2, [0]].mpg)
```
This gives back a `Series` since we're selecting the column from the `DataFrame`.

<img src="../images/r_logo.png" class="language-icon">

Here's the R equivalent using `c()` for creating a list with **mpg**:

```{r rows-column-dropped-single, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
mtcars[1:2, c('mpg')]
typeof(mtcars[1:2, c('mpg')])
```

The values returned are fine, but we got a `double` vector instead of a dataframe! 

**Python ⇒ R GOTCHA!** Unlike Python, subsetting a single row and column using `[` returns a vector not a dataframe. R will drop the dataframe dimension and return a vector instead.

This is similar to the selecting a single column using `[[` issue from earlier. 

To fix this, we would have to instead supply an additional parameter `drop` and setting it to `FALSE`:

```{r rows-column-dropped-single-fix, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
mtcars[1:2, 'mpg', drop=FALSE]
typeof(mtcars[, 'mpg', drop=FALSE])
```

Now we get a dataframe back which is just a `list` in R.

Now, we can still subset this further using **mpg**:

```{r rows-column-dropped-single-fix-subset, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
mtcars[1:2, 'mpg', drop=FALSE]$mpg
typeof(mtcars[1:2, 'mpg', drop=FALSE]$mpg)
```
And this is a vector as expected.

Congrats! You made it across the field! Now, on to bigger things.
