## Introduction

In this (very) short guide, we're going to cover some key concepts using dataframes in R by relating it to the language you are comfortable with, Python. Think of this as an interactive tutorial document, where you are going to read some text but most importantly, you are going to make use of a lot of "learning by doing" and play with code to reinforce the concepts. We shall use the **mtcars** dataset available in R throughout the tutorial.
