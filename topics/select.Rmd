## `select`

Another handy verb is `select` which allows us to select columns much more easily than using `[` and will even allow us to deselect columns as well. Let's select the **am** (transmission) and **gear** columns  of `mtcars`:

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(mtcars)
```

The syntax is `select(data, cols)` where the data is a dataframe or tibble and the columns can be either comma-separated labels, a list of labels using `c()` or indices. Let's look at the column names first:

```{r select-demo-1, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
select(mtcars, am, gear)
```

Note how the column labels after the `mtcars` do not have to be quoted. You can also make use of that `%>%` syntax so we only print the first few rows if you want. Examine the code below and note that labels can be quoted as well:

```{r select-demo-2, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
select(mtcars, 'am', 'gear') %>% head()
```

In fact, `select` is flexible enough to allow using `c()` where the items are not quoted:

```{r select-demo-3, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
select(mtcars, c(am, gear)) %>% head()
```

but here also, the items can be quoted:
```{r select-demo-4, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
select(mtcars, c('am', 'gear')) %>% head()
```

### So what?!

Isn't all this just a different syntax that pretty much does the same thing as `[`? Well, yes but including the flexibility shown above, `select` has some other nice capabilities that we don't get from `[`.

#### Range-based column selection

Suppose we wanted to select a range of columns like from **mpg** up to and including **hp**:

We could do so using `.loc` in Python:
```{python echo=TRUE}
mtcars.loc[:, 'mpg':'hp'].head()
```

Well, you can do the same in R with `select`! Go ahead and try that now to select columns from **mpg** up to and including **hp**:

```{r select-columns-range, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r select-columns-range-hint-1}
"select"
```

```{r select-columns-range-hint-2}
select(mtcars, 'col1':'col2')
```

```{r select-columns-range-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, select(mtcars, 'mpg':'hp')), "Isn't that neat?")
)
```

#### Reordering columns

Let's take a brief look at reordering columns of a dataframe. Let's suppose we want to put the **carb** (last column) all the way at the front, followed by **cyl** then finally **mpg** and the rest of the columns.

There isn't an easy way we can achieve this in Python. One method is to simply extract the columns list then swap using list indexing:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cols = mtcars.columns.tolist()
cols = ['carb', 'cyl', 'mpg'] + cols[2:-1]
mtcars[cols].head()
```

In R, you could do it in base-R, but this makes it quite confusing and suffers the same issue as Python in that you can to keep track of what the index was for each column.

```{r select-base-reorder, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
total <- ncol(mtcars)
mtcars[, c(total, 2:1, 4:total-1)] %>% head()
```

R's `select` makes this very easy, and this is also where convenience functions in `dplyr` becomes, well, convenient:

```{r select-reorder, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
select(mtcars, carb, cyl, mpg, everything()) %>% head()
```

`everything` selects all the other columns not already selected so far. It is just one of many other [utility functions](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html#useful-functions).


#### Dropping columns

Let's say we want to drop some columns like **mpg** and **hp** and select the rest.

In Python, one could do so using `drop()` in Python. But the main limitation behind this is that it is 1) rather tedious and 2) you're constrained to specifying columns using a list:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars.drop(['mpg','hp'], axis=1)
```

If we wanted to drop a range of columns, say from **mpg** to **hp**, dropping columns using a range is not straightforward in Python.

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.drop(mtcars.columns[0:4], axis=1).head()
```

or using `.loc`:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars.drop(mtcars.loc[:, 'mpg':'hp'], axis=1).head()
```

In R, `select` makes this a lot easier, simply use `-` in front of the column label:

```{r select-drop-minus, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
select(mtcars, -mpg, -hp) %>% head()
```

or using list:

```{r select-drop-minus-list, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
select(mtcars, -c(mpg, hp)) %>% head()
```

**GOTCHA!** Using `-` to drop columns using labels is also not possible in base R:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars[, -c('mpg', 'hp')]
# Error in -c("mpg", "hp") : invalid argument to unary operator
```

Dropping by range is also much easier than base R, using column labels:

```{r select-drop-minus-range-label, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
select(mtcars, -('mpg':'hp')) %>% head()
```
```{r select-drop-minus-range-unquoted-label, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
select(mtcars, -(mpg:hp)) %>% head()
```

or indices:

```{r select-drop-minus-range-num, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
select(mtcars, -(1:4)) %>% head()
```

Hopefully you have come away feeling like `select` is an extremely useful verb to select and drop the columns we want. On to the next verb, `filter`!

#### If you want to learn more:

We have just begun to scratch the surface of the useful capabilities of `select`. For example, there are many useful utility functions available to further filter columns, which you can learn more about in the reference [page](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html).
